4Hire

Problem Statement
A major limitation to the expansion of our domestic businesses and prospects for self-employment is our small population, which results in a small market for any goods or services we offer. In light of this, the growing global freelancing economy has a significant potential to offer self-employment opportunities to many skilled Bhutanese adolescents who are currently unable to support themselves. The reason to build a website called “4Hire” is to create a convenient platform for Bhutanese to start their freelancing journey.
